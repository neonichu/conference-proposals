# Building Better API Clients in Swift

As we are almost through the second year of Swift's existence, we have figured out how to write API clients at all in Swift, but how do we write them well? 

In this talk, we will learn to make our API client adapt to change more gracefully, using Hypermedia. How can we make our APIs more accessible with interactive Playgrounds and comprehensive documentation? How can we use code generation to bring the advantages of type safety to clients for more dynamic APIs? Finally, we will learn how to set up our tooling to ensure our quality goals will be met with every release.

During the talk, live coding will be used to apply every step to a Swift client for a real-life API.
