I have been working with iOS for about 5 years now and am also an active participant in the OSS community as a core contributor of CocoaPods, author of other build tools, like xcode-install and of several Xcode plugins. 

I have presented at a bunch of conferences all over the world, see http://buegling.com/talks for an overview of my previous talks.
