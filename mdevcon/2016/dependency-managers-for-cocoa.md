# Dependency Managers for Cocoa

CocoaPods has brought dependency management to Apple platforms a few years ago, but by now several 
other options have emerged, like Carthage or more recently Apple's Swift package manager. This talk 
takes a look at different implementations of dependency management and how they compare, which can 
help you choose the right option for your use case. We will also investigate how using a tool compares 
to managing your dependencies manually. Finally, we will build a small component and see how we can 
make it available using all the different options while not having to do the same work multiple times.
