# Cross-platform Swift

Swift is now not only available on all four Apple platforms, but also on Linux â€” and possibly soon
elsewhere as well. Each platform has some peculiarities, but we want to write at least some of our
code in a way that works on all of them, e.g. to share a piece of business logic between our iOS
application and the server-side. This talk gives an overview on which APIs are available 
cross-platform and how we can effectively build components that work everywhere.
